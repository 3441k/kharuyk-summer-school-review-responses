2. Add and commit all files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`, `README.md`)
3. Push to the `main` branch
4. Enable GitHub Pages in your repo settings, select branch `main` and root folder

## Notes

- Ratings and comments are saved **locally in your browser** using `localStorage`. Different users on different browsers/devices will have separate data.
- For shared multi-user data, a backend or cloud database integration would be needed.
- The app uses [SheetJS](https://sheetjs.com/) to parse Excel and CSV files.
